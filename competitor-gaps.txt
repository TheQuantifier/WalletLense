Gaps to differentiate (not clearly advertised by competing OCR+budgeting+advice apps)

1. Explainable advice with clear "why" plus concrete next steps.
2. Item-level OCR with verified totals plus confidence scores and correction flow.
3. Budgets that auto-adapt to bills and subscriptions with renewal-based forecasting.
4. Deeper scenario planning (e.g., "if rent rises 5%, what happens?").
5. Privacy-first / data-minimal positioning, including on-device processing where possible.
6. Searchable receipt vault with exportable audit trails.
7. Multi-currency budgets and FX-aware reporting.
8. Shared budgets with roles, permissions, and approvals.


Here’s a clean competitor map for WiseWallet based on your feature set (budgeting + expense tracking + receipt OCR + reports). I split it into direct and adjacent competitors so you can position clearly.

## Direct Competitors (Personal Finance / Budgeting + Tracking)

YNAB (You Need A Budget) — well-known budgeting app. (apps.apple.com)
EveryDollar — zero‑based budgeting app by Ramsey Solutions. (everydollar.help.ramseysolutions.com)

Expensify — receipt scanning (SmartScan) + expense workflows. (use.expensify.com)
Shoeboxed — receipt scanning + expense reporting. (shoeboxed.com)

If you tell me your exact target user (consumer vs freelancer vs SMB, and US‑only vs global), I’ll trim this into a tighter competitive set and map each one to their strongest differentiator.
