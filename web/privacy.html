          WiseWallet ("we," "us," or "our") values your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, how we share it, and your choices when you use WiseWallet.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We may collect:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Account information: name, email address, username, password hash, and profile details you choose to provide.</li>
          <li>Financial content you provide: income and expense records, categories, budgets, notes, and reports.</li>
          <li>Receipt and document data: uploaded files, extracted OCR text, and parsed metadata.</li>
          <li>Authentication and security data: session/device information, login activity, and optional two-factor authentication data.</li>
          <li>Support communications: messages you send through support/contact forms.</li>
          <li>Technical information: IP address, browser/user agent, and basic usage logs for security and reliability.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
        <p>We use information to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide and operate WiseWallet features.</li>
          <li>Authenticate users and secure accounts.</li>
          <li>Process receipt uploads, OCR, and AI-assisted parsing.</li>
          <li>Store and show your financial records and reports.</li>
          <li>Respond to support requests.</li>
          <li>Detect, prevent, and investigate abuse, fraud, and security incidents.</li>
          <li>Improve product performance and reliability.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Google Sign-In</h2>
        <p>
          If you use Google Sign-In, we receive basic profile data from Google such as your Google account ID, email, and profile name. We use this information only to authenticate your account and link it to WiseWallet.
        </p>

        <h2>4. How We Share Information</h2>
        <p>
          We do not sell your personal information. We may share data with service providers that help us run the app (for example, cloud hosting, storage, email delivery, OCR/AI processing), subject to contractual and security controls. We may also disclose information when required by law, legal process, or to protect rights, safety, and platform security.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>
          We retain account and app data as long as needed to provide services and comply with legal or operational obligations. If you delete your account, we delete or de-identify data according to our system design and retention requirements, except where retention is required by law.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Security</h2>
        <p>
          We use reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational safeguards to protect data. No system is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Your Choices and Rights</h2>
        <p>
          Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or export personal information. You can also manage some account settings directly in WiseWallet. To request privacy-related actions, contact us using the support details provided by the app.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          WiseWallet is not intended for children under 13 (or the applicable age in your region), and we do not knowingly collect personal data from children.
        </p>

        <h2>9. International Data Transfers</h2>
        <p>
          Your information may be processed and stored in countries other than your own, where privacy laws may differ.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>
          We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will update the Effective Date above and post the revised version in the app or website.
        </p>

        <h2>11. Contact</h2>
        <p>
