        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          Our mission is to remove complexity from personal and small-business finance. WiseWallet exists to 
          replace manual tracking, fragmented tools, and error-prone workflows with a single, intelligent 
          platform that delivers clarity, accuracy, and confidence at scale.

          We believe financial tools should work quietly in the background—while users stay focused 
          on growth, planning, and decision-making.

        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          WiseWallet was built by developers and data-driven problem solvers who experienced firsthand 
          how inefficient financial tracking can be. Existing tools were either overly manual, fragmented, 
          or unintuitive—forcing users to spend more time managing money than understanding it.

          We set out to build a modern alternative: a product that combines automation, thoughtful UX, 
          and intelligent data handling to turn financial noise into usable insight. WiseWallet is the 
          result—a focused platform built to scale with users as their financial needs grow.
