# Next Steps

- Improve onboarding to first insight in under 2 minutes (demo data, quick scan of accounts).
- Define and surface north-star metrics (savings rate, net worth trend, cash-flow).
- Add fast editing flows: bulk recategorize, split transactions, undo.
- Add explainable insights (spending spikes, MoM changes, goal progress).
- Accessibility (WCAG AA), offline-tolerant views, locale/currency support.
- Budgeting modes: envelope, zero-based, and category caps.
- Goal automation rules (round-ups, allocate X% on paycheck).
- Cash-flow forecasting (30/60/90 days) with confidence bands.
- Recurring transaction detection with reminders.
- Net worth dashboard with assets/liabilities and trend.
- Data quality: dedupe, reconciliation, import normalization.
- Categorization model with user overrides and feedback loop.
- Data integrity checks (balances vs transactions) with confidence indicators.
- Security: MFA, session management, anomaly detection.
- Encryption at rest/in transit; secret rotation; least-privilege RBAC.
- Privacy controls: export, delete account, retention policy.
- Background jobs with retries and dead-letter queue.
- Rate limiting, circuit breakers, and graceful degradation.
- Migration strategy tested on large datasets.
- Performance targets (P95) for key routes and dashboards.
- Observability: structured logs with correlation IDs, tracing, metrics.
- SLOs/alerts for failed imports and auth spikes; audit logs.
- Compliance: terms/privacy, consent, GDPR/CCPA readiness.
- Bank-connection provider compliance requirements (if applicable).
- Competition “wow”: money coach, scenario simulations, summaries, shareable report.
